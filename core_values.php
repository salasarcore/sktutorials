					<p style="color: #000000;"> Any institution that has to go a long way, is always guided by certain values. The core values that guide the functioning of SK are as mentioned below.</p>

					<p style="color: #000000;"  class="align-justify"><span class="orange">Trust:</span> Trust is an essential human value. Like oil, trust is the lubrication that brings the members   together and keeps team marching ahead to achieve success.</p>
					<p style="color: #000000;" class="align-justify"><span class="orange">Quality:</span> Quality is never an accident; it is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, intelligent direction and skillful execution; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives. We believe that QUALITY makes a lasting IMPRESSION.</p>
					<p style="color: #000000;" class="align-justify"><span class="orange">Honesty:</span>A honest person is one who displays integrity, is genuine and not deceptive or fraudulent. Honesty is characterized by truth and sincerity.</p>
					<p style="color: #000000;" class="align-justify"><span class="orange">Integrity:</span> Integrity is doing the right thing, even if nobody is watching.</p>
					<p style="color: #000000;" class="align-justify"><span class="orange">Teamwork:</span> Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The ability to direct individual accomplishments toward organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon results.</p>
					<p style="color: #000000;" class="align-justify"><span class="orange">Excellence:</span> Excellence is the unlimited ability to improve the quality of what you have to offer.</p>
					<p style="color: #000000;" class="align-justify"><span class="orange">Leading change:</span> Change is hard because people overestimate the value of what they have and underestimate the value of what they may gain by giving that up.</p>
					<p style="color: #000000;" class="align-justify"><span class="orange">Learning & Sharing:</span>Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. You can teach a student a lesson for a day; but if you can teach him to learn by creating curiosity, he will continue the learning process as long as he lives.</p>
					<p style="color: #000000;" class="align-justify"><span class="orange">Respect for Individual:</span> Respect for ourselves guides our morals; respect for others guides our manners.
